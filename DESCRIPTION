Description: From the Language Environment Analysis System (LENA) 
  Iterative Time Segments (ITS) files, import information from 
  recordings, blocks, and segments, then orders information into 
  centiseconds- and seconds-from-midnight (ITS_to_seconds). Bin into user-specified 
  minutes-from-midnight (bin_seconds). Remove unwanted recordings 
  from ITS file (remove_recordings). 
  See https://github.com/htanderson/ITSbin for full documentation.
